🌟 The killer feature: Tool Notebook

Think Jupyter notebooks but for developer tools:
• Combine JSON formatting → UUID generation → Data conversion
• Drag & drop to reorder cells
• Custom naming ("API Parser" vs "JSON Formatter")  
• Share entire workflows

Perfect for data processing pipelines! 🔄

🚀 Revolutionizing Developer Workflows: Introducing work-bench.dev

As developers, we constantly switch between different tools for data processing, formatting, and validation. What if there was a way to chain these operations together seamlessly?

Today, I'm thrilled to introduce work-bench.dev - a terminal-inspired Progressive Web App that brings Jupyter-style notebooks to developer tools for the first time.

🌟 The Game-Changer: Tool Notebook
Imagine combining JSON formatting, UUID generation, and data conversion in a single, flowing workflow. Each tool runs in its own "cell" with independent state, just like Jupyter notebooks. You can:

• Drag and drop to reorder operations
• Add custom names to tools for better organization  
• Share entire workflows with your team
• Process complex data pipelines without switching apps

🛠️ Comprehensive Tool Suite (21+ Tools):
The platform includes everything developers need:

📝 Data Formatting: JSON, YAML, SQL formatters
🎲 ID Generation: UUIDs (v1/v4), Short IDs, Nano IDs
🔤 String Processing: Length analysis, cleanup, escaping, slugification
🌍 Time Utilities: Timezone conversion, epoch timestamps
📊 List Operations: Compare, deduplicate, sort, extract unique items
🔄 Data Conversion: CSV/YAML/XML to JSON transformation
📝 Text Processing: Random generation, formatting, cleanup
🎨 Image Tools: Pixel coordinate finder
🎮 Bonus: 4 retro games (because why not?)

🏗️ Built for Modern Workflows:
• Progressive Web App - Install on any device, works offline
• Terminal aesthetic with dark/light themes
• Privacy-first: 100% client-side processing
• Keyboard shortcuts for power users
• One-click copying with instant feedback
• Lightning-fast performance with Vite

💡 Real-World Use Cases:
• API Response Processing: Validate JSON → Extract UUIDs → Convert timezones
• Data Migration: Clean CSV data → Generate IDs → Format for database
• Content Processing: Clean text → Generate slugs → Convert formats
• Testing Workflows: Generate test data → Format responses → Validate outputs

This project represents months of thoughtful development, focusing on user experience, performance, and genuine utility. It's open-source and completely free.
